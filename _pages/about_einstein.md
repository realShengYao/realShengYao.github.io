I'm a Computer Science and Engineering Ph.D. student at <a href='https://hkust.edu.hk/'>The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</a> (HKUST). I'm advised by Prof. <a href='https://www.cse.ust.hk/~weiwa/'>Wei Wang</a>.

Before that, I spent a wonderful gap year as a Research Assistant at <a href='https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/'>Institute of Parallel and Distributed Systems</a> (IPADS) in Shanghai Jiao Tong University, advised by Prof. <a href='https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/pub/members/zhaoguo_wang'>Zhaoguo Wang</a>.

I enjoyed a three-month research advised by Prof. <a href='https://naizhengtan.github.io/'>Cheng Tan</a> from Northeastern University in 2022.

I received my B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering in <a href='https://www.osu.edu/'>The Ohio State University</a>. Once a Buckeye, Always a Buckeye.
